Some important things we might want to consider for the experiments and/or message:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Early playout terminations}. When a playout is started from state $s$, descend $d$ plies by 
      choosing actions according to a playout policy to reach state $s^d$, then return the value 
      of the $v^{\tau}_0(s^d)$. In Kalah, \UCTH uses early terminations with $d = 0$. 
      In previous work in Amazons and Breakthrough, and some domains with chance, 
      best performance is achieved for $d > 0$. 
\item {\bf $\epsilon$-greedy playouts}. 
      At state $s$, the playout policy chooses randomly with 
      probability $\epsilon$ and chooses an action $a \in \cA(s)$ that maximizes $v_0^\tau(\cT(s,a))$. 
\item {\bf Constant/Progressive bias.} Constant or progressive bias defines $\hQ$ as in Equation \ref{eq:imq} 
      except replaces $v^{\tau}_{s,a}$ with $v^{\tau}_0(s')$ or with $v^{\tau}_0(s') / (n_{s,a} + 1)$, respectively. 
\item {\bf Node priors} (Lorentz paper claims this make large difference in Breakthrough)
\item Probably the most similar competitor is \UCTMAXH from \cite{Ramanujan11Tradeoffs}. \UCTH
      is standard UCT with early playout terminations ($d = 0$). \UCTMAXH is the same, except maximum backpropagation
      is used. Note that \UCTMAXH is different from implicit minimax; implicit minimax keeps the average computed by 
      the playouts and minimax values separately, benefiting from both sources of information. I expect implicit minimax
      to work better than \UCTMAXH, but it might be nice to show this (esp. in Kalah). 
\item The extension to games with chance nodes is straight-forward. It might be nice to show it, though. There is a tactical 
      candidate game growing in popularity (Chinese Dark Chess). Probably not going to happen -- just not enough time {\tt :(}
\item Implicit max$^n$ in Hearts. If this works well and we want to include the results, we'd 
      change the formulation a bit to talk about the $>2$ player case~\cite{Sturtevant08An}. 
\item For Chinese Checkers we should also try Progressive History~\cite{Nijssen10Enhancements,Nijssen13PhdThesis} since it was 
      shown to work quite well there. See also~\cite{Roschke13UCT}.
\item Simple regret / observed error? We need a small game that's solveable so we can compute the optimal minimax values.
      Small Chinese Checkers?
\item Seems like, at least from our observations of watching experiments in Breakthrough, implicit minimax could be better at 
      detecting/defending ``fortresses''~\cite{Guid12Fortress}. 
\end{itemize}
